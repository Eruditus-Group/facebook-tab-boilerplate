facebook-tab-template
=====================

A basic HTML facebook tab boilerplate

Usage
--------------
Just download this repository, and start creating content within the <div id="content"> ... </div> tag.
Your file system should be on an HTTPS server, as most of the users have switched to safe browsing.
However you should provide at least a redirect on the HTTP version of your application, because otherwise users that don't have safe browsing enabled will see a 404 error.

App settings
--------------
An example of the most current app settings can be found in the app-settings.jpg.

**Basic configuration**

**Auth dialog**

**Advanced**
The height should be fixed to 800px if you want to achieve that your iFrame grows automatically.
